description: A brief introduction of myself!

Welcome to my blog! I'll be posting here of new technologies I find interesting, details of my homelab, and much more! The plan is to begin a consistent schedule of documenting what I do in my day to day times.

I'm a Systems Engineer/DevOps Engineer at the moment, administrating Linux systems and developing automation for my team through the use of Ansible, GitLab CI/CD, and Terraform. I'm an avid homelab guy, having amassed a few too many servers that I plan to use for various things.

I also like coding, working heavily with python and bash scripting (I know, not coding), to develop various tools and make my life easier. At one point I built myself a workout tracker with Python! I enjoy taking day to day tasks and over-engineering them for no apparent reason! 

Anyways, stay tuned for more posts here at TierThree blog!
